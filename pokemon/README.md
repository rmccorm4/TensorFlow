# Deep-learning with Pokemon
Going to attempt some sort of network architecture with pokemon models as inputs

Unsure of the usage currently, possible ideas include:
* Mashing two pokemon together into a single model
* Doing some sort of combination of one pokemon's model and some art style (Style Transfer)
	* Think inputing pikachu and van gogh's starry night to get a night themed pikachu rather than yellow
